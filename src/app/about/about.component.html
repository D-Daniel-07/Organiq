    <p>
      One fascinating aspect of organic farming is its emphasis on biodiversity and ecological balance. Unlike conventional farming, which often relies heavily on synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, organic farming encourages natural methods of pest control and soil fertility. For instance, organic farmers often use crop rotation, companion planting, and natural predators to manage pests, reducing the need for chemical interventions. By fostering diverse ecosystems within their farms, organic farmers can enhance soil health, support pollinators, and maintain a healthier balance between crops and local wildlife. This approach not only produces food with lower chemical residues but also contributes to overall environmental sustainability by conserving biodiversity and promoting resilient agricultural systems.
